## Supplementary Materials

* Source codes:
1. Source Code of FMEmT.R
This is the source code for the Fast Model-ready Emission Tool used in the paper, as a replacement of SMOKE model to process emission files into netcdf format for CMAQ model.
2. Source Code of Fast Iterative Optimization.R
This is the source code for the Fast Iterative Optimization method used in the paper.
3. Source code RegionMapper.R
This is the source code for the RegionMapper used to create the region file, as the format of ISAM or DDM region file.
4. Original MEIC-HR.7z
This is the original MEIC-HR emission for the CP8C regions including two domains. The emission files were processed from MEIC-HR 2017 released by the MEIC Team of Tsinghua University.
5. Optimized emission for the CP8C region.7z
This is the optimized emission files for the CP8C regions.
